# 🫀 Heart Failure Prediction using Machine Learning  
A Machine Learning project for early detection of heart failure using clinical data and patient risk factors.

## 🎯 Project Overview  
Heart failure is a major health issue worldwide. This project focuses on predicting the risk of heart failure using a publicly available dataset. By training and evaluating multiple ML models, we aim to identify high-risk patients based on key features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate.

We built a full end-to-end machine learning pipeline with data preprocessing, visualization, model building, evaluation, and feature analysis.

## 🗂️ Contents
